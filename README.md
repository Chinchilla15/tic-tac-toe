### Description
Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. 

The main goal for this proyect was to put into practice advanced techniques like factory functions and closures. 
The program was successfully built using factory functions and their different methods. No global variables were used.

Throughout the creation process of the game, I was able to understand and implement various JavaScript techniques. I invite you to check my code to see how it works and have a look at the different techniques applied :D
(I also found myself having a hard time trying to get a draw when playing against myself!)

### User interface
For the user interface, I added an elegant and minimalist design that is easy to use and understand.  I also incorporated visual color changes for interactivity and accessibility.
